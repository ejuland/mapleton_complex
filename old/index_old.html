                        It has been over two weeks since you have last seen him. Knowing him, he would have brought
                        enough
                        supplies
                        to survive twice as long. This wasn’t the first time he disappeared off the radar for this long,
                        but
                        it
                        has
                        never felt this foreboding. The last time you heard from him, he said he was going back to the
                        site.
                        Why
                        was
                        he so obsessed with the place? In your opinion, it was nothing more than a remote pile of rubble
                        which
                        has
                        served as a gathering spot for miscreants despite the warnings and trespassing signs.

                <div class="story-paragraph">

                        He always insisted that there was more to it than that. “Consider the size!” he would interjet
                        any
                        time
                        you
                        tried to convince him of the place’s insignificance. Though you didn’t want to admit it, he had
                        a
                        fair
                        point. According to local legend, the place had employed hundreds of workers in the late 40’s
                        with
                        the
                        purpose of developing technology to support the war effort. However, less than a decade after
                        its
                        establishment, the facility was vacated and left desolate for years ever since. Every time you
                        went
                        with
                        him, you couldn’t help but feel that the place was unusually small considering all of the rumors
                        and
                        lore
                        surrounding it.

                <div class="story-paragraph">

                        The facility was located north of the city deep within the forest. You would have easily missed
                        the
                        trail
                        leading to the site if he hadn’t pointed it out to you. Off the side of one of the mountain's
                        switch
                        backs
                        was a faded dirt trail just wide enough for a small truck to fit. The trail made a steep descent
                        down
                        the
                        side of the mountain and ran alongside the river. After following the trail deeper into the
                        forest,
                        you
                        would eventually begin to see the warning signs telling you to “turn back”, “trespassers will be
                        prosecuted”
                        and more messages with the likes of that. The messages however were never enforced. The
                        government
                        obviously
                        had more important places to focus on.

                    <p>

                        When you got to the site itself, you couldn’t help but wonder how a large operation could have
                        existed
                        here.
                        Undoubtedly there had been a government presence here. The most notable thing about the site was
                        the
                        disused
                        rail tracks which ran around the perimeter. It was apparent that the place was used for some
                        mining
                        operations long ago. You could still see some of the neglected equipment rusting by the side of
                        the
                        mountain. Apart from that, there was limited evidence of the government's occupation. All that
                        remained
                        was
                        a guard station, a toppled watch tower, and a few concrete walls on a foundation no larger than
                        a
                        small
                        gas
                        station. You had scoured the place on many occasions, but never found anything more significant
                        than
                        graffiti, some mouse droppings, and shattered glass. Despite all of this your friend still had a
                        fondness of
                        the place which bordered pure obsession.

                        “That’s why I'm here”, you think to yourself as you step out of your truck. As the cool dusk air
                        brushes
                        across your face, you can’t help but feel a little more relaxed. Under normal circumstances you
                        would be
                        tempted to stay the night just to enjoy the peaceful environment that the mountain provides.
                        However,
                        just
                        as you predicted, you notice that your friend had parked in his usual spot. Relieved, you draw
                        closer to
                        his
                        vehicle knowing that he usually sleeps in the back. When you arrive, you notice something
                        peculiar.
                        Instead
                        of his normal sleeping gear, the bed of his truck is filled with rudimentary excavation
                        equipment.
                        As
                        you
                        scan the site you observe that many parts of the foundation have been broken into pieces. It is
                        getting
                        dark
                        now, so you reach into the bed of his truck and grab gloves and a flashlight from the haphazard
                        pile
                        of
                        tools lying in the back.

                    <p>

                        Night has fallen by the time you approach the site and you see a faint warm glow reflecting off
                        one
                        of
                        the
                        walls near the center of the facility. As you draw near the wall, you can clearly make out a
                        man-sized
                        hole
                        which appears to be the source of the soft glow. Your attention is caught by a long rope
                        anchored to
                        the
                        wall which descends into the hole. As you look down you are surprised to find that the hole goes
                        down
                        far
                        deeper than you expected. It could easily be a thirty-foot descent to the bottom of the palace.
                        You
                        try
                        yelling down into the pit, but you get no response. Praying you don’t find your friend in a
                        mangled
                        heap
                        at
                        the bottom, you don your gloves, inspect the anchor, tug on the rope a few times for good
                        measure,
                        and
                        proceed to repel down into the pit.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-paragraph">

                        <img class="right" src="./elevator.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>

                        As you reach the bottom, you are confused to find that the light source was not your friend. In
                        fact,
                        the
                        only trace of him was the rope that he left behind. The light source came from what appeared to
                        be
                        an
                        old
                        freight elevator. As you debate whether to investigate further you are startled by the sound of
                        the
                        rope
                        hitting the ground with a heavy thud behind you. You infer that the anchor had come undone. You
                        take
                        a
                        moment to compose yourself and then decide to investigate the elevator further. You reason that
                        your
                        friend
                        couldn’t be too far ahead of you. You step through the open doors and find a brass panel to your
                        right
                        with
                        two vertically-aligned buttons. Wishing that your friend is on a higher floor, you attempt to
                        press
                        the
                        top
                        button to no avail. After many futile attempts, you feel a gowing weight in your stomach as you
                        realize
                        that
                        your only hope of finding your friend and getting back up is by going down. You take a deep
                        breath
                        and
                        reach
                        for the bottom button…
